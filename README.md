The purpose of this code sample is to focus on how to use PredictHQ's event features and integrate them into your existing forecasting model, so we won't focus on how to tune, train, or cross-validate an XGBoost model. Although I am using Amazon Sagemaker and XGBoost model here, the model architecture is agnostic to ML platforms and forecasting algorithms.
